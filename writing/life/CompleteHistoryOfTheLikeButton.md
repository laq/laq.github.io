Ok that sounds to big, all My knowledge is more realistic

Starting on the big bang, to the creations of the stars
and their collapse explode process that leads to the creation of different elements in the periodic table.

Further away gravitational fields create planets and thus the Earth.
On of this elements created is silicium, and it ends aup being in some places on the earth.
This elements properties allow it to be what we call a semi conductor,
it will conduct energy depending on external factors.

On the other side, there is a mixture of chemicals, warm, electricity, called the essential soup, from this, either on earth or elsewhere the first amino acids are created, this start - slowly, very slowly, with glaciar pace - to change and become more complex eventually creating the first cell, a first entity that keeps an internal process, searching for energy and using it. But more important of all, one of those cells was compelled to use this energy towards creating more of it self. And thus started a multimillion year process of what we call evoluion.
But be aware that 
"Evolution doesn't design things it doesn't build systems-it settles on systems that, historically, conveyed a survival benefit(and if a better way comes along, it will adopt that.) "

Eventually this multiple cells started to diverge and compete, and in this process a war race started, step by step adding new caracteristics, like sensors to detect the environment and make energy gathering more efficient, or actuators, to move towards rich sources of energy, or to escape from dangers, be it climate or from other cells. 

At some point they started to work together, in complete symbiosis, creating more, bigger and more stable organisims. Those where an individual cell is almost disposable, but almost each cell serves a purpose.

The divergence of all this cells became more apparent as their strategies got specialiced, some would absorb the energy from the environment, be it nutrients, or even sunlight; some would gather that energy from other cells, essentialy getting the energy the first ones gathered; some would process any kind of left over the previous two left, being the recyclers of the process; there are some others that in their layziness they just hung to some of the previous, and use their internal machines to aid their reproduction, the highjackers. But most important of all, all of these competed for the limited resources, which is what permits the evolution process, but also makes life more a harsh path, than a garden of roses. - Or maybe yes they don't have those thorns because they are the latest trend! -.

Eventually those multicelled organisims specialiced more, and "learned" that mixing information from others created what seemed and avantage, so bisexual organisims started multipliyng.
Eventually leading to mammals, primates and finally humans.

Those humans then learned how to harness their highly developed brains and flexible actuators to build for them selfes what ever nature was not providing. (And to be incredily narscicistic considering themselves unique.)

Through a constant expansion process, where more and more of this individuals needed to be feed, they changed their constumes and the environment, to allow for the producttion of that much energy that was needed. Naturally this process as with all organisims competing for finite resources, led to conflict.
In that these humans are essentially the same as those primarial cells. Shouting to the four winds, "It is my way or the highway".
This process of conflict and eternal crave for more, led humans to improve their understanding of their environment and use that understanding to their benefit. They call it technology.

And now we return to our friend the silicon. Sitting calmly inside a mountain; found by humans and probed. Humans in their eternal curiosity, maybe motivated by an insasiable desire for learning, or an insasiable desire for governing, found that the properties of this material allowed to further build one of their ideas. The computer.

First this silicon allowed to enable or disable the flow of electricity (Maybe more story on the discovery of electricity?) through a bit more of electricity passing through it (Should search this properly).

This allowed the creation of transistors, which when joined together allow the creation of a NAND gate.
With this NAND we can create al other gates for basic boolean logic.
AND, OR, NOT, XOR. With this gates and using a numeric system based on 1s and 0s (binary). The gates ar not only able to do boolean operations, but also math.

Combining them another way also, it is possible to create selections, so energy gets transfered to a desired output (Multiplexors).

Additionaly, if this gates are criss-crossed, outputs to inputs a "flip flop" is created. This one is now able to return the state of a previous input. Effectively remembering the last step. Now we have memory. 

With, Memory, Multiplexors, Booleand and Calculating gates a Multipurpose processor can be built.
One which can be as complete as a Turing Machine (A theoretical computing machine that can compute anything computable as long as it has enough tape. Also the benchmark for complete processing capabilities. Turing Complete).

Once this processor is built, with similar combinations of principles learned here and there, output mecanismis, for printing or displaying are built. Or for inputing like keyboards using capacitors to measure which keys are pressed. Or displays that sense changes in electric conductivity to deciide where in the screen the finger is touching. 

Then an operating system is needed to control all the devices and allow for multiple programs to run and share those devices.

On top of the operating system programs run. Such as a browser.
This browser asks for a web page (A social network),
Typing its name, it then gets translated via a DNS query to a number (ip) that uniquely identifies every device connected on the planet (Connections made possible via cables laid down or Electromagnetic waves manipulated and interpreted to transfer this information.)
Once connected to the source of the social network (or one of it servers to be more precise) 
A comunication starts between both machines (OSI)

Eventually loading a photo of the person you like, a friend, a romantic interest, or a family member.
A surge of .. (Oxcitosin or Serotonin? or Dopamine?) spikes in  your blood flow, the smile on the picture, activates different neurons in your brain that, through empaty and your memories with the person make you smile as well. You feel warm for a moment, then as you been trained decide that this feeling, be it warmnes, happiness, or somtimes even envy, you press the like button.
