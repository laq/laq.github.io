I do not know what is my quest, or my calling.
I do not know yet what will come, I am not sure what to do or where to go.
But I do know that when and if the quest comes, I shall be ready.
I do know that the world is huge and, to our small minds and experience, it appears random.
I realize then, that to be ready I have to learn about the world and its people.
I have to be a more complete "hero".
I believe that the confidence a leader has to proyect comes not only from his heart,
but also from his mind and scars.
But then, to be that leader in the moment of need, or the warrior, wizard, or halfling that stands at his side,
one has a need to build up his skills, knowledge and scars. 
That means that through giving it all, concious thought, learning and failing is how the seed germinates into a hero.
Then as they say, the master will arrive when the aprentice is ready; and the quest will arrive when hero is as well.
